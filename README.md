If you don't have git on your machine, [install it]( https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wise4rmgod/image/upload/v1541677789/clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the clone button and then click the *copy to clipboard* icon.


where "url you just copied" (without the quote marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.
```

```
```
<img  width="300" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wise4rmgod/image/upload/v1541677697/cloneandroid_github.png" alt="copy URL to clipboard" />
where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository in GitHub to your computer.
## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory in your android studio (if you are not already there):

<img  width="300" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wise4rmgod/image/upload/v1541677473/create_branche.png" alt="copy URL to clipboard" />

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now open `Strings` in your android studio, add your name to it. Put it anywhere in between. Now, save the file.

<img  width="450" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/wise4rmgod/image/upload/v1541677510/addname_here.png" alt="git status" />


If you go to the project directory , you'll see there are changes.


Add those changes to the branch you just created.

```
git add Contributors.md
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:
```
git commit -m "Add <your-name> to Contributors list"
```
replacing `<your-name>` with your name.

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:
```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```
replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a  `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

<img style="float: right;" src="assets/compare-and-pull.png" alt="create a pull request" />

Now submit the pull request.

<img style="float: right;" src="assets/submit-pull-request.png" alt="submit pull request" />

Soon I'll be merging all your changes into the master branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.

## Where to go from here?
